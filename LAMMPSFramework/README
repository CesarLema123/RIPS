This file contains directories which hold the files needed to compute bulk modulus,
thermal expansion coeff., diffusion coeff., elastic properties, and orientation interfacial energy.
It also contains the lib folder which stores python processing scripts as well as general versions of the scripts found
in the other directories.

In order to compute a parameter, 
	- Enter the directory of interest
	- Edit the run***.sh file so that the PYTHONPATH variable adds the correct directory for lib/PyScripts
	- Edit the run***.py file to whichever thermodynamic variables you want to run simulations 
	- Type ./run***.sh to run the script

What is happening when you start a run,
	- A directory called Out is made in the current directory
	- For each set of input parameters, a folder like RunTime***Size***Temp***Conc***Length*** is created in Out
	- All of the files in the directory specified by the copyDir variable in run***.py are copied into this directory (For the ones given it is called In)
	- The thermodyanmic boundary conditions are written to the top of an input file called in.fileName where fileName is specified in run***.py 
		and the file specified by inTemplate (run***.py) is written below
	- This input file is then run in the new directory
	- After the simulation is complete, another directory is made and another run starts

Data collection functions which integrate with the structure are specified in the sims.py file.
Each property has its own Python object associated with it which has a calculate function to get the desired property.
The best way to call these functions is to do so in the run***.py below the run command so that all of the thermodynamic
	boundary conditions are the same and errors don't occur due to missing directories (though some error handling of this sort is included).
GrainBdry is the only one which does not have a data collection function. The results of the simulation are written a file called log.results 
	which can be found in the directory in which the simulation was run
